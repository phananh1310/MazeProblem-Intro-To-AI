# MazeProblem-Intro-To-AI
This tiny project is all about the search problem, using 4 searching techiques: DFS, BFS, A*, Greedy Best First Search and JavaFX.
I did't set any getter/ setter for this project since it's based on structured programing, not OOP. (I use Java because now I only know how to implement GUI by this language)
I know I need to handling some unexpected Errors, shiny GUI, optimized algorithms .... but anyway, I did this for fun in a few days so .... xD

Some important things:
  - node package: contains information about a Node in search tree
  - algorithm package: contains some searching algorithms
  - application package: contains the FX related things
    + controller.java: include Make maze, some button Action event handling and some modified parameters (sizing, time delay, ...)
    + main.java: just to launch the program
